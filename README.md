Express.js Displaying static contents using PUG templating engine content

This repo just contain static data displaying, next repo will display dynamic data...

Pug files have ".pug" extention and are stored inside the views folder.

we need to register the templating enine we are using in the main file app.js.

 We render .pug file using "res.render()" and we eneter the name of pug file inside it without ".pug" extention
 
 Pug file actually gets converted to html file on runtime
